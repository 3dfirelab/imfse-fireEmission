# IMFSE-practical UNIT 4 - WildFire Behavior Modelling - Fire Emission

This is the material for the first practical on fire emission at atmospheric scale.  
![greece2007](./images/greekFireGFAS-2007.png)
Above (bottom panel) is a simulated map of aerosol optical depth @ 550 nm (blue colorbar), generated using GFAS emission based on FRP retrievals from satellite observation (in this case Meteosat SEVIRI, red-yeallow colorbar) and the atmospheric model used within the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). The simulation shows the smoke from the fires moving SW across north Africa. Subsequently the winds shifted and the smoke was forecast to blow across Italy, significantly affecting air quality there around 3 days after its was first emitted in Greece.

### Objectives:
- load and plot [GFED4](https://daac.ornl.gov/VEGETATION/guides/fire_emissions_v4_R1.html) data.
- load and plot [GFAS](https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cams-global-fire-emissions-gfas?tab=overview) data
- observation of fire Season Emission
- accessing active fire data.
- assess the impact of the fire of El pont de vilomara in the Spanish and Catalan fire season emission.

### Technical Requirements: 
You need a jupyterlab environment running to run the two notebooks of the practical:
- [1-GFED/load_GFED_data_example.ipynb](./1-GFED/load_GFED_data_example.ipynb)
- [2-GFAS/load_GFAS_data_example.ipynb](./2-GFAS/load_GFAS_data_example.ipynb)  

See [README.md](../README.md) to use one available on andromeda UPC server.  

### Notebook Structure and **Deliverable**
Each notebook is structure with first a section where you can follow the code, helping you accessing and plotting the data. A second section ask you questions to help you go further into the data. Finally a last section ask you questions that you should answer in a small reports to deliver at the end of the practical, Reports are made by groups of two.
